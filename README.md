# Zike 

Zike was created to be a representation of the app we all know and love nike. When i was thinking about what project i wanted to do i knew it would be nike because i love there shoes and i have played sports my whole life. Zike is a full stack nike clone where users can look through a bunch of products they may want to buy. Users may also log in and add whatever nike product that they enjoy to the site. Once the user creates their desired product they can also update/delete them. A user may also read and write reviews with a star rating with their opinion of the product.
